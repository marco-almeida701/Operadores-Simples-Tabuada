### **Note: This is my first project. With this project, I had the opportunity to practice and improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. I learned how to structure the content of a web page using HTML, style it with CSS to enhance its appearance, and add interactivity using JavaScript. Although it may not be perfect, I'm proud of my progress and excited to continue learning and improving my coding skills.**
